Hi, I am Kevin and together with my friend James has we started Blackbeard, where we are trying to provide server hosting based on containers. Simple and easy, right? But you may ask why another server hosting provider, isn't there enough of them? Let me try to explain it a bit further.

## What we are doing

There is a new technology terminology call software containers, and because of a company called Docker, it has become really accessible and easy to use. The idea is like if you think of a real container, it does not matter what you put inside the container, it always looks the same from the outside. The same with a software container, it does not matter what you put inside, it always runs the same, it is easy to move around and it is lightweight, which means that you can put many of them together.

But there is a problem with software containers, it is very difficult to publish your container! We just wanted the simplest hosting solution, which took advantage of all the benefits of containers. We have a lot of experience building websites, but do not like all the time we were spending maintaining and keeping our websites up. We searched and tried a lof of different solutions online, but all of them were either too complicated or not a platform as much as we liked.

The problem with the existing complicated solutions is that there is too much configuration, that should not be needed if done correctly. The problem with the other solutions that they would often only offer to help you maintain your own servers. The problem with that is that if a server goes down or need to be updated, it were our own job, so there were still too much work comparable what could be offered.

## The solution

We are providing a full-service solution to developers, so the only thing that has to focus on is there website! We will take care of all the rest which includes, provision hardware and configuration, software updates, load-balancing which means redirecting traffic to the website and secure deployment. All the developer has to do it to push the software container to us and we give back a url where it can be accessed. It can't be any simpler and if you want to update the website, you just push a update to that container, we will spin up that new container and take down the old ones, without you having to do anything.

## Who are we?

A quick description, so you know who is behind Blackbeard. We are two guys that both lives in Copenhagen (sadly no pirate background), where we currently work from a coworking space called FoundersHouse. FoundersHouse is a really awesome startup community. It is so much better than sitting a home for yourself all day, and if you every come by in Copenhagen you should come by!

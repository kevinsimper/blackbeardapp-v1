We charge you upfront for using Blackbeard, which means that before you start any containers you must have some money in your account that will be used against your usage. This is different from what others are doing, where they normally charge after the end of the month. We thought about this intently, but came to the conclusion that we had to do it.

## We do it for a couple of reasons

First as a two-man startup we only have our own money and since we have no investors, we are renting the servers that the containers will be on with our own money. That means that we need money upfront so that we can rent servers upfront as well.

Secondly, because we need to be sure that the money is there we charge the money upfront to guard against bad people that will try to trick us and use our service without ever paying. If some bad people misused our service, the only people left paying is you and we don't think that is fair!

## You are safe

We really aim for charging the smallest amount of money that you need to run the containers. We made it such so that you can decide yourself how much money you want to fill up each time we charge your credit card.

And to make sure that you don't feel uncomfortable, if you ever want to get your credit from your account, we will transfer it back to you on your request.

But we will probably change this in the future so that you pay for your usage at the end of the month.

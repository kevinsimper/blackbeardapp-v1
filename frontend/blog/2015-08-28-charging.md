We charge you upfront for using Blackbeard, that means that before you start any containers, you must have some money on your account that will be used against your usage. This is different from what others are doing, where they normally charge after the month has ended. We really thought a lot about this, but came to the conclusion that we had too.

## We do it for a couple of reasons

First as a two-man startup we only have our own money, and since we have no investors either, we are renting the servers that the containers will be on with our own money. That means that we need the money upfront so that we can rent the servers upfront as well.

Second because we need to be sure that we can get the money, so by charging the money upfront we can guard against bad people that will try to trick us and use or service without ever paying. If some bad people misused our service, the only people left paying is you and we don't think that is fair!

## You are safe

We really strive for that we only has the smallest amount of money that you need to run the containers, and because of that you can decide yourself how much money you want to fill up each time we charge your credit card.

And to make sure that you don't feel uncomfortable, if you ever want to get your credit from your account, we will transfer it back to you on your request.

But we will properly change this in the future so that you pay for your usage at the end of the month.

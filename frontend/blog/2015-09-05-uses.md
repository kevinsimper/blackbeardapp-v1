To help explain what Blackbeard is and how we can help you as a developer I will take you through 2 common use cases for the platform. The first use case will be a user with a small NodeJS app and the second use case will be a more advanced PHP application hosting a travel companies website.

In both cases we assume the user has gone through the Blackbeard user registration process and has a valid account with sufficient credit to run their new containers.

The node developer will have created his app and made a Docker container on his local machine before considering using our service. His node application is very simple and runs independantly of other containers. At the point he is happy with the amount of development he has done he will push his app to us.

With a `docker push` the user will find through the Blackbeard website a new container has been added. From this container he can then create a new online application based on this container. Once this is done a URL will be presented to the user. This URL can then be distributed among his friends to show off his brand new node app.

Because of the nature of this user's application and because it is not intended for more than a handful of users the entry level Silver pricing level will be fine here. If his web app starts to grow and he finds himself in need of more performance he can easily upgrade to Gold and Diamon levels later on.

The second scenario is a more professional application of Blackbeard. A travel company that currently receives 400 hits per day on their PHP website. The site includes an online booking function and a payment facility. To store it's data the site uses a MariaDB database, which is encapsulated in a mariadb container. Due to most it's users coming from Hamburg, Germany, where the company is based the deployment options for the website set to reflect this. So after the container is pushed to us we can provide this user with the option to deploy 

... Load balancer?

Gold level..

To help explain what Blackbeard is and how we can help you as a developer I will take you through 2 common use cases for the platform. The first use case will be you as a user with a small NodeJS app and the second use case will be a more advanced PHP application hosting a travel companies website.

Of course we assume you are an existing Blackbeard user :) We also assume your account has sufficient credit to run your new containers.

# Simple node App
As a node developer you have created a simple app and have made a Docker container on your local machine. A simple docker container is made to package your application and is complete before you start considering using our platform. At the point you're completely happy with the amount of development done you can push the app to us.

With a `docker push` you will find on our website new container has been added under your account. From this image you can then create a new online application based on this container. Once this is done you're presented with a URL, which can be sent to your friends and to show off your new app.

Because of the nature of this simple application and because it is not intended for more than a handful of users the entry level Silver pricing level is fine here. If your web app starts to grow and you find yourself in need of more performance you can easily upgrade to Gold and Diamon levels later on.

# Travel Website
The second scenario is a more professional application of Blackbeard as a developer at a travel company. Your travel company is doing well with it's physical store front based in Hamburg, Germany. You created a website to supplement this physical store and to refer potential clients to more information online. This also opened the door to receiving their payments via the website for their holidays.

After launching last year you started receiving a steady amount of traffic, which your website and server provider struggled with. Slow load times and telephone complaints about not being able to complete transactions has left you being put in charge of releasing the site on a more reliable and flexible platform.

You decide to recreate the website on your local developer machine inside a Docker container. Using various runtime metrics in docker you are able to stress test the container and see that with 500 unique visitors on the site at one time you will require a significant amount of memory. Because of you choose the highest level of service from us, which is the Diamond level.

Through the application setup process you can push your main application container and, due to the website using a MariaDB database, you can also push a generic container of that. Presented with connection details for your new database container you can modify your main application to connect to it.

In this example with the company being based in Hamburg you select that you your application should be deployed in the Western Europe region. This will ensure your applications are delivered in the fastest way possible to your target market.

If in the future your company grows and you want to provide different servers in different regions you can deploy additional servers in other regions and push a load balancer container to our service. This would still be Diamond level but the more diamonds the better, right?

I hope from reading these 2 examples of potential uses for Blackbeard you have a better understanding of the service we are providing. The tl;dr of this entire post could be *if you have a container push it to us and we will host it*.

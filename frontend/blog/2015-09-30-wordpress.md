Your amazing WordPress blog needs to reach it's millions of avid readers. And it needs to reach them today :P

I am going to run you through the steps required to deploy a WordPress blog on the Blackbeard platform. You firstly need an account on Blackbeard, which can be made at:
[http://blackbeard.io/signup](http://blackbeard.io/signup).
![Sign up page](/images/blog/blackbeard_signup.png)

Once you are signed up you will need to set a username in the interface:
![Username field](/images/blog/blackbeard_setusername.png)

Follow the instructions presented on the page: `docker login -u username registry.blackbeard.io`.

Now let's get the wordpress image from DockerHub: `docker pull wordpress`

Once you have the image you can tag it with the blackbeard registry:
`docker tag wordpress registry.blackbeard.io/username/wordpress`

And push it up to us:
`docker push registry.blackbeard.io/username/wordpress`

If you don't have Google Cloud account you can sign up for one here: https://cloud.google.com/. They offer a free trial on their Cloud platform if you haven't previously signed up. There is extensive documentation on setting up and using this service at https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/getting-started, which features a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/_kQXgjIfLgo) on creating an instance.

I was careful here to choose an appropriate *Region*, *Tier*, *Backups*, *IPv4 address* and *Allowed networks* for my app. As this was for a test application I set these to the following:
- Region: europe-west1
- Tier: D0 - 128 MB RAM
- Backups: Disabled backups
- IPv4 address: Assign an IPv4 address
- Allowed networks: Network - 0.0.0.0/0

Now the MySQL instance is running take note of the IP it is assigned. You will need to create a user for WordPress to log into the database as too, which is done from the "Access Control" tab under the  "Users" sub-tab.

Now your MySQL instance is running you can test this from your computer. Replace "Public IP" here with the actual IP of the MySQL instance.
`mysql -h[Public IP] -uwordpress -p`

Now you have the database ready to use you can create a new App on Blackbeard. From the Dashboard I click the "Create New App" button. I enter a name, select the wordpress image I pushed previously and select a port to expose:

Interface stuff to set env variables. In my case because I am hugely security-conscious I set them to:
![Environment variables](/images/blog/blackbeard-env-vars.png)

I then return back to my App page and click "Start Container".

And voil√† WordPress is running online: ![It's alive!](/images/blog/wordpress-running.png)

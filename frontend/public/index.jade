  h2 How it works
  ul
    li You create the app you want and build a dockerfile to specify how to run it
    li You push it to us via the docker cli
    li We host it for you, with automatic scaling, load-balancing, etc.

.works
  h2 Behind the scenes
  p We have a docker registry, where we store your docker image securely.
  p We give you a CNAME that you point your domain to.
  p We use powerful servers and because of the nature of containers, it allows us to run many of them together together in our custom cluster. We have multiple load balancers to tunnel the traffic to your containers. Redundancy layers are provided by ensuring at least two containers are running at any point in time.
  p We choose not to build any loging mechanise, as we found there were several more dedicated for logging your applications output. We highly recommend loggly.com and papertrailapp.com.
